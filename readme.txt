Redirect 404's when a visitor tries to access a page protected by Groups.

- the WordPress login

The redirection can also be applied for restricted categories, tags and other taxonomy terms if [Groups Restrict Categories](https://www.itthinx.com/shop/groups-restrict-categories/) is used.

The redirect status code can be selected among:

- See other (303)
- Temporary Redirect (307)
